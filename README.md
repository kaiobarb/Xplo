# Xplo
Tell a story, find a place.

Our website is hosted [here](xplo.pythonanywhere.com/Xplo)

### Our Story

Xplo started as a platform to put sentimental meaning onto places. People have experiences all the time, and a lot of the time they go unshared. Xplo allows you to share your story with the world! The story may be short and sweet such as starting school for the first time. Or it could be in depth and have a lot of meaning such as the plasce you met your best friend. Regardless of the story, Xplo is a place to share.

Others can view stories and be able to learn about others in a way they could not otherwise. You may find that the place you had an unforgettable experience is also the place another person had a funny story to tell. It connects people by the experiences they have in the places they have been.

It's a story land that begs to be explored

### Story Behind The Name

We wanted Xplo to be a place that one can explore the stories left by others. We spent quite some time thinking of a name and we just wanted people explo' all these stories. Thus Xplo was born.

### Ideas For the Future
We were able to implement many of the features we had thought of, but some were left by the wayside. Namely, we would like to see a 'like' feature, where users can express interest in other users stories, and add the ability to sort/search stories by the number of likes, among other search criteria like tags. Another aspect of the site that could be tweaked for the better would be the markes. Although they are clear and descriptive on their own, they look cluttered when there are too many within a close range/zoom level. Adding custom markers that fit the theme and aesthetic of Xplo, as well as a feature that could clump markers together given their proximity would be an ideal fix.

### Conclusion
This project was incredibly useful for as, as we learned a lot about building dynamic websites. Our knowledge of git and servers went up exponentially, and we are grateful to have taken this class. We believe the core concept of exploring places through stories offer great potential for growth, and we hope to continue development on this project.
